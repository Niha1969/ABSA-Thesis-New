Battery life is excellent and the screen is bright.
After the update the phone became slow.
"Battery drains fast, very frustrating."
"Performance is great for the price, but fans are loud."
Screen bleeding and poor customer support.
UI design feels premium.
Privacy concerns after last update.
Too many permissions.
Decent performance but battery usage high.
Crashes when opening.
Support doesn't reply.
First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.
Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is.
Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max.
It just slipped & slid all over.
Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!
I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain.
Third: the tripod is also useless.
I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter.
It’s just inefficient for the job imo.
Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.
They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.
I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I’m buying.
Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.
"Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too."
Guess I’m going to have to pay more.
"Idk if they were damaged in shipping or what, but the lenses were loose or something."
I could see half a lens with its edge in the frame and the rest was missing.
It looked like it came loose or was broken.
They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts.
"I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great."
They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case.
I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!
When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones.
Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord.
I was searching for a sturdy backpack for school that would allow me to carry my laptop as well as schoolbooks.
"After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers."
I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag!
Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away.
"While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus."
"Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright."
"So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage."
I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane.
I've bought these headphones three times because I love them so much and overuse them and find ways to break the plug to where I can't use my warranty.
The sound and bass are awesome.
Hands down my favorite headphones in this price bracket.
"Light weight, quiet and totally awesome!!!"
"It doesn’t come with a charging base, but the cord ends in a USB so you can plug it into a phone charger or portable charger."
It’s so light and works great!
It’s really quiet also!!!
Update 2-they sent a new warranty replacement.
Good company.<br />Update- was 5 star until they left headphone died after 1.5 years.
Will contact support.<br />old:<br />love them. a bit noisy when you're jogging. but solid for biking or chilling around the house
If my phone is in my pocket it will stay connected where ever i go.
I love listening to things without being attached or tethered to my phone.
It also makes it harder for my kids to pull the earphones out of my ears when there is no long cord attached to my phone.
I love the 1 click pause feature so i can quickly pause what i am listening to talk to someone (i don't have to go find my phone and swipe and pause).
They are comfortable and stay on really well for my ears.
I have taken them running and they stayed on as well.
I had an issue about 1 year after I bought the headphones and the customer service was wonderful and understanding. really great product and I will continue to purchase and recommend these to my friends.
pretty good for the price.
yes.. so good. just buy it. my favorite feature is it auto connects and remembers my devices.
This devices brought my wifi network to its knees.
Not sure why this has good reviews.
My devices had a hard time connecting.
And even if my devices weren't connected it would hog a bunch of bandwidth and slow the whole network.
I personally would just buy an AirPort Extreme.
That solved range problems for me.
"Works well, but the corner of the plastic cracked and is broken after a month or so."
I think at least 2 of the plastic corners are cracked now. still works but wish it was higher quality.
I play with 1 in fully and 1 ear in 1/2. really nice. good product. buy rechargeable batteries to go with them you'll save $$$
"this really deserves 3 stars. its not terrible, but its not great. first is sound quality. its not terrible."
"2nd is limited distance. its not terrible, but not great.<br /><br />I wish I had found a better product."
These work great for 8x10 frames.
Bought to get stronger WIFI to my upstairs level & it works great!
Great value for the price!
This is the 3rd Sony Blu Ray player I have bought & have been impressed with them all.
My kids love the wi fi streaming options.
Love Otterbox cases.
These have protected my 7 & 9 year old's IPods with lots of drops & wear & tear.
great product. high quality. fits perfectly.
Pretty cool!!!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.
My son and grandson put it together for me in about 3 or 4 hr.
Time out for dinner and couple of beers.
Back to putting it to finish and test it out.
Fit right in the same corner a much smaller stand was in Clean looks with the wires now.
"Just a normal cable, works great for my external monitor!"
The system is a little confusing but the manual helps a lot.
Once you get the hang of it you'll love it.
It's a nice gentle way to wake up.
"Works great with my pixel 2, I can charge quickly while listening to music."
Great for music/podcasts and receiving calls.
The microphone isn't set up that close to my face but still captures my voice clearly.
I am not sure how much protection this provides - certainly less than a camera bag - but it will protect against scratches and small bumps.
It fits my Canon EOS Rebel T6i w/ kit lens very well - like a glove.
"Awesome product, fits well on my mac."
Would definitely recommend.
I believe the electrical boxes are made especially to fit in a recessed (in wall) TV mount fixture.
That is perhaps why it is made narrower.
In the comments I am not seeing anyone using it for this.
I would love to hear if someone used it placed inside a recessed mount and how it worked.
Don't know why I didn't get one of these years ago..it's saving me $9 a month rental fee i was paying Comcast
Worked great for a vacation monitor.
Had no issues with my MacBook.
"Good resolution, no dead pixels."
Very easy to carry around
This has been a great headset for video conferencing all day.
"Comfort is great, mic quality is great and when I do play music it sounds great too."
Can easily hold 2 pairs of headphones and looks great!
Sound quality of my dt 990 much improved compared to just hooking up to my phone.
Would recommend to everyone.
Small and easy to use
These are incredible value for the money.
All of the included parts have worked for a few months and are still in great quality.
We use them at lunch for an hour each day with smash.
Stick great to my desk and provide ample spaces for all of my cords.
The color coding is more useful than I thought originally.
"Since each one has two spots, I had enough for my desk and bed night stand."
This pair is fantastic for the price I paid(just over 50$) .
"There are a little long and tall which forced me to move my two fans around them, but that is more case design flaw than anything."
I haven't had any issues with them and have used PNY for a long time.
Had for about a month now.
Still running strong and keeping my twc ultimate internet on all 8 of my houses devices.
Goes through three rooms and I'll lose just a small fraction of speed (10mbps loss for a ranch style house).
"Very easy to configure, fits my 11.6&#34; Alienware very well."
I can focus air on my Gpu and WASD keys to prevent from getting hot.
Easy recommendation to anyone who needs a cooler for intense applications.
My WASD keys barely get hot and my Gpu runs much more stable.
Everything works great on the hub with my Samsung Galaxy Pro S5e.
Must visually confirm that connector is fully extended by looking at slide groove.
Mine seemed DOA until I realized that it wasn't making electrical connection.
Any small screw dropped in my computer case seemed to end up inside the bottom mounted power supply.
This filter will keep them out.
Bought four of these to use in a RAID.
All four of the boxes had PN: 98D648 - 550 on the box.
When I installed one of the drives it was smaller than the others.
PN on smaller drive's label was 98J146 - 308 and it was called a Barracuda 7200.10.
Larger drives were Barracuda 7200.11 9BX154 - 303 on the drive label.
Returned it and will check the replacement when it arrives.<br /><br />7/3/08 Received replacement drive and it was Barracuda 7200.11 9BX154 - 303.
Thin material but perfect to hang for a photo backdrop.
This product is as good as advertised.
The cost is attractive; considering you will likely replace them again in the future.
I’ve attached a pic of the old and newly installed pads for comparison.
15ft is exactly what I wanted.
Fits my MacBook Air perfectly!
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
"The first time I zipped the first pouch, the zipper broke."
"I tried another one, same thing, zipper broke on the first try."
Not very accurate in tracking steps taken.
Wrist band started coming off after 3 months of use.
Very very slow processor.
Great sound quality.
Fits both the iPad Air & Air 2.
Comes with a removable inner lining.
When removed it fits the iPad Air.
"Bought it in December 2014, still in great shape."
The wireless subwoofer makes it easy to place any where in the room.
Arrived sooner than the original really long estimated date.
Remote wall bracket included.
No ceiling or wall mounting hardware included for the screen.
Very quiet operation.
"Moves very slowly up/down, but no big problem as the projector is usually getting up to temperature."
"High vinyl odor, but that's fading, since installed 4 days ago."
Does hide-away nicely and seems unobtrusive.
This cameras seems to focus on what “it” wants.
I will try to capture and watch an area by moving the cameras visual area using the app but it will quickly return to another area.
Not even the same area as was before I decided to look elsewhere.
It tends to bounce anywhere it’s little heart desires causing me frustration and non use.
A little crackly at times but not that noticeable.
Just turn the volume up.
"To me, this was a waste of money."
Not useful on a plane or really anywhere.
"Too short, once bent, leaving no surface space so phone wants to fall off."
Son uses it to hold Beats and Jaybirds.
Traveled well and protected items.
"My son likes it,holding up well considering how much weight he puts in it.So far so good!"
love them so much thank you
Very sturdy and well made.
My AirPods fit snugly into the case and the cases latching button is magnetic and closes easily and is very secure.
The charging light is visible as there is an opening for it built into the case so you can see when it is light up red or green and the charging port is accessible so you don’t have to remove them to charge them.
They clasp onto my purse sturdily and I have no worries about them becoming dislodged from my purse and getting lost.
If you want to use a different clasp it’s interchangeable with one of your choosing of the same size.
Great quality for a great price.
Somewhat disappointed.
Works as advertised except this desk is not wide enough and therefore your computer is not centered for typing.
I’m order to do my homework I have to set it up as shown in my photo (move computer to center of desk instead of where it’s supposed to sit) which leaves little room for my mouse to be used.
This is the only flaw I am seeing so far.
The projection screen itself is not wrinkle free and the stand is super flimsy.
I'm just going to end up using some heavy duty velcro strips to hang the screen without the stand.
Just brought this TV in March and the panel is screwed.
Turns out it's a manufacturers defect.
Trying to get this TV replaced or repaired has been HELL!
I had been calling support since March and finally got through at the end of July.
I've been transferred to 3 different departments just to get the exchange finalized.
No one has made any effort to contact me about when or how this exchange will take place.
I love my new larger screen Kindle.
It fits my Chromebook perfectly.
It did not amplify anything.
All I heard was a buzzing sound.
I'm so disappointed.
I purchased this for my Nana who is 94 yrs old and doesn’t have cable.
It was simple to set up (follow instructions on TV settings to setup) and my nana now has more stations and way better quality visually as well as for listening because the stations no longer go in and out!
Definitely worth the money.
Pretty cool design...still figuring out how to get the mp3s added for swimming!
"I needed this for work and it was easy to install, I use it daily."
"Have only had it a few weeks but so far, so good."
It comes with a long cord too which is a good feature.
Super happy and got it on promo!
"came as advertised; delivered before date-of-delivery; good value for money<br />radio standard, depending on your car, may need install kit for your car;<br />I needed kit for my 2013 Toyota . . .<br />suggest you measure area opening of dash where radio is to be mounted"
nice to have an accident plan just in case of the unexpected . . .
good to have security just in case: not expecting any trouble tho. . .

looks like original / wouldn't tell the difference if it didn't say replacement . . .
haven't used any yet. . . .needed some extra cables when I'm ready to install more SSD's. . .
perfect fit in 3.5 slot. . .the dual holder allows to install extra SSD any time. . . or you can go with a HDD for more storage space
"easy install in my HP computer, perfect fit/ no problems with clean install win 10/very satisfied. . ."
using this addlink in a desktop and my laptop / easy install. . . perfect fits. . .did help increase speed of my computers. . .
this was a gift. . . he said he liked it. . . . .that's all the info I have on this item. . :(
"wife wasn't satisfied with overall operation. . . .I liked it tho, but had to put it back in the box"
used once to test it out. . . . .worked great. . .
it worked fine / great conversation piece too!
perfect item for a novices user as I am. . .
Great hard drive for the price!
Installed with no issues in wife's Dell computer: She's very satisfied:
Great little device!
Works perfectly: Glad I browsed through Amazon and found it:
"It looked okay, but the camera was faulty: had to return item :("
Great camera! i am really pleased: Just what I was looking for. . .
good to know I have if needed. . .
good wiring kit; everything we needed to install amp and subs
perfect fit. . . this shade of blue matches the lavender tablet
WORKS AS PROMISED. . .GOOD ITEM. . .
WORTH THE MONEY; VERY GOOD BACK-UP AMP; LIKE ALL THE EXTRAS. . .
tried two other routers: they worked for a while but begain to loose their continuity: I read upom the TP-LINK Router and liked the specs and the price wasn't bad either: connected the first time and have not expirienced any problems even when we lost power... router came back up with noooo problems
i use this cable to connect my satelite box to the tv: works great: clear picture and sound: even had a little bit extra which is good
I use this in conjuction with the HDE VGA RAC/S-Video Adapter: did not have to re-arange any furnishings in my bedroom: this cable allowed me to connect my pc to the tv: good clear picture
"sometimes in my room I watch movies on my computer: this adapter allows me to watch on a bigger screen: since the tv I'm using is an older model, this adapter is perfect: clear picture"
"due to the location and arrangement of my computer components, this cable was a life saver. my printer is kind of far away from the computer: this cable was perfect. . ."
great item for the price; already had in mind how I was going to run cable: works like a charm
used this cable to connect office wide screen tv to my computer. .it worked perfectly. clear picture. did what I expected it to do
awsome. . .just what I was looking for. . .came on time; works great; going to have to order more for friends
"this was a perfectly good item, but I could not use it: I ordered the wrong cable. . .It came on time as promised."
"I gave it to a friend, and he is happy with it. . ."
MONITOR IS EVERYTHING i THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND MORE.
"REALLY LIKE THE ""PICTURE-N-PICTURE OPTION."
NO DAMAGE IN SHIPPING AND ARIVED WITH IN THE TIME SPECIFICED.
"I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR FOR ANY COMPUTER SYSTEM ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE YOUR COMPUTER TO WATCH TV OR MOVIES. . .ONE TINY LITTLE THING THOO; THE MONITOR SPECKERS ARN'T THAT GREAT, BUT I USE OTHER SPEAKERS ANYWAY."
A GOOD MONITOR FOR THE PRICE.
MY FRIENDS ALL THOUGHT IT COSTS MUCH MORE.
Literally a lego fitted to be a key cap.
"Probably wouldn’t spend another $25 on it for myself, but good craftsmanship."
Got it for my boyfriend for a birthday and I already know he will love it because I sure do.
Would recommend to anybody.
This is exactly what we needed for our new Arlo Cameras and the best price!
These batteries during use have a good life.
Standby life is poor.
They discharge in 7/10 days of standby.
For a recreational photographer this limiting.
My granddaughter is overjoyed!
My Grandaughter was VERY HAPPY
great gift from wife.
Just what was needed.
"This cover does not fit my Kindle, so I guess Im stuck with it!"
Not very happy with this item.
"I'm giving it three stars because, although the case and keyboard cover are good (I really like those), the sleeve has already started ripping."
I haven't even had this for a week.
It's kind of disappointing actually.
I love the colors of the case and keyboard cover though!
"But for the sake of the sleeve, which I thought was essential, I have to give it a sleeve."
They fall off almost immediately.
Pretty much useless.
Works exactly as described! 👍
The tv overall is really good.
Good picture and better sound quality than I expected.
The user interface is quick and responsive.
I did get a little frustrated with some of the initial set up - but nothing too bad.
The remote seems a bit on the cheap side - but it works well.
These are the best and most reasonably priced earbuds I have ever had.
I use them when I run and they consistently perform well.
Great picture quality - but the mic doesn't work as well.
This is a great little speaker.
Has really good sound for its size.
Very good battery life as well.
There are more expensive speakers available that have better sound quality - but this one is really good for the price.
These are great inexpensive ear buds.
My only complaint would be lack of bass in the music.
"Other than that, these are a good low-cost selection for some wireless buds."
I use mine every day at work.
Easy to use - great battery life - pretty good sound for such a small speaker!
What else could you want??
Definitely worth the money.
This replaced an old Ipad that I had and it is so much better.
Really fast and has a crisp/clear display
Exactly as advertised.
This is the second one of these I have purchased over the years.
I workout a lot and my Ipod goes with me every time.
This case stands up well to a lot of use.
The ear buds take a little getting used to - but the music quality is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!
"I like nice n thickness, and compact iam going to buy me another one."
One of the chargers gets scary hot.
I can’t even use it.
The chargers are inconsistent and do not always work.
When they work it’s a very slow charge.
Set up is very easy.
The video is pretty good.
I paid for a year of CAM Plus and I am still only getting 12 second videos.
The 12 second videos tend to be the person walking away.
I did a chat with Wyze support.
Their suggestion did not help.
I called and talked with support.
Their suggestions did not help.
He told me he would send a request to “tier 2” and they will contact me by email.
It’s been a full week.
Customer service is a huge deal.
I don’t want this camera if I can’t get more than 12 seconds of video.
Takes beautiful pictures and easy to use.
Came with tons of fantastic products.
"Got these a few years ago, loved them then and now."
"Great sound, battery is great, all around 5 star product!"
Hopefully theses last longer that the last two sets from different companies so far so good
Stopped working in less than o month.
Amazon was not helpful in getting replacement wanted me to send it back for repair even though it was listed for return for another month.
Bad bad customer service
When I use the kindle app it’s perfect for holding my ipad
Product was as it was described.
Didn’t come with earbuds like a brand new iPad though
Easy to use good sound quality nice and small perfect For the deck
i made no attempt to iron it on or sew it to fabric. looks great though
"do discernable lag in spite of 30' length<br /><br />good audio and video quality, however 2160p and htz over 60 are both capabilities impossible for me to test<br /><br />widthstood being nailed to baseboards, over 2 ethernet cables, with 3/4"" plastic staples"
"As long as you follow the directions EXACTLY, it’s easy to apply"
"CIYUPE Tablet Pillow Stand, Tablet Holder Dock for Bed with 6 Viewing Angles, Compatible with iPad Pro 9.7, 10.5,12.9 Air Mini 4 3, Kindle, Galaxy Tab, E-Reader and Books (Grey)."
It is great at holding tablets and phones at whatever angle of its 6 possible positions is most appropriate.
"Comfortable to use, takes pressure off hands/wrists when using"
The multiple lengths come in handy for different uses.
"The 3 foot wire is perfect for in the car while the 6 &.10 foot wires are perfect for the desk, couch, or bed."
1of the 3 died immediately after purchase.
It lasted maybe a week.
The others are fine & I haven’t had a problem with them.
"But I bought 3 because I needed 3, not 2."
I would definitely recommend this for a cruise or a bedside table.
We are continuing to use it at our charging station.
Highly recommended this durable product
It works like it should.
After I received the butterfly bag I was not sure if my great niece's Kindle with the big rubber protector would fit.
But it fits perfectly in this bag.
It will work just fine.
"But not for the camera I got it for, it's too big."
Gave it as a gift to my great niece to put her new Kindle Fire for kids in it.
She already had Kindle in a rubber cover but it fits all of it and her charger.
can change for any holiday or time of year. holding up and fit nice. sime issues with them coming undone but not with all of them.
"Did not fit, returned"
"Unfourtunatly this did not fit, returned"
"Works as expected, holding up good, no issues, good buy"
I returned it because it was too wide for the chest I was going to set it on….
Exactly as described
Very small and unimposing support.
Looks and works great!
I bought this for adding wired Ethernet to the Google Chromecast with Google TV and it works perfectly.
No more lagging connection.
Using this over rabbit ears on my LG OLED and it does pick up some channels but almost all of them have weak reception.
Even with the amplifier on high it doesn't do a great job.
"Could be the location, I'm gonna try to put it in the attic and see if it helps.<br />Does work for picking up NXTGEN boradcasts so that's pretty cool."
Only get 2 if the 12 channels available though.
If your kids throw things this will not save the remote.<br />We have dropped it a few times and its fine.
"But when it was thrown at the stairs it still cracked.<br />Basic protection, but not enough to save from angry children!"
This is much higher quality than expected.
"Doesn't sag like other long extension mounts I've used.<br />It's a bit difficult to extend and retract, but I think that's a good thing so it's not flopping all over.<br />Highly Recommended!"
Best price drive and it's FAST.<br />Moved 450GB of games from internal storage to this M.2 in 6 minutes 47 seconds.<br />PS5 rated read speed at 6257MB/s when it started.
"A bit slower than rated, but still should be sufficient for PS5 usage."
I've had 0 issues so far.<br />The PRICE IS UNBEATABLE.<br />Let's hope the longevity doesn't match the price.
"Works well enough, microphone and pairing work well."
But does not have NFC.
The NFC functionality is a big portion of the remote and it states a different model.
Will be leaving seller feedback as well.<br />Be careful folks.
I have 2 JBL and an LG portable Bluetooth speaker and this was too large for any of them.
One of the JBLs was barely long enough to be held by the straps but I didn't feel confident in how secure it was.
The other 2 were just 2 short.
I didn't think they were small speakers but apparently they are too small for this Mount
I did lower the Sub output to -6 so that I don't feed too much power to the converter and it works great.<br />It's not the most elegant setup but it's outta site in the corner behind my couch and it sounds superb so I don't care.
"This replaced a 12"" JBL venue sub from about 15 years ago."
I have always liked Klipsch but this is the first home audio product I have owned of theirs and I am super happy.<br />I use this in conjunction with my LG SK9Y sound bar.
I removed the speaker cables and fed them into a Low level line converter and that runs to the LFE input on the subwoofer.<br />It works wonderfully and really fills in as much as or better than the Venue did before.
MILES BEYOND the stock 8 inch on for the sound bar.<br />I would recommend this sub for any home audio system.
It's not small though so make sure you have room.
I installed this in the back of a built in.
"Had 24"" to clear and it did fine, but it sages down about 1.5 inches and I wasnt expecting that much."
"I left that much clearance luckily, so it barely rubs, but it can block the IR since I have a sound bar wall mounted also.<br />TV only weighs about 25 lbs so I have no idea how bad it would be if you used the max capacity of 60lb.<br />If it didn't sag so bad it would be 5 stars though."
"Easy install and works well, feels solid."
"Put these in for my 2021 Sienna sliding door speakers because the aftermarket 3.5"" speakers had too much bass and were rattling the panel."
"This is the perfect frequency, blocker."
Still allowed the mids without the bass rattle.
Picture shows ok on static image.
However when using for XBOX picture cuts out during flashing action segments.
Picture will go completely black until action subsides then it will show static picture again.<br />Very poor quality.
"I have upwards of 30 Kasa switches, bulbs and other accessories in my house."
They all work AMAZING.
I love the app and all the options they keep adding.
The smart features and customizability just works flawless.<br />They almost never lose connection and quickly respond to google assistant commands.<br />This is really nice because I can make routines through google home to turn everything off but still have specific items on or off at my desk.
"I have my work and personal pc, fans, lighting, headset, etc all on different switches."
I actually have 2 additional single switches in the same area and they all work great together.<br />Super easy to wall mount and stays put very well.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the main power LEDs on the switch are a bit bright and they don't turn off at all.
There is the main switch and 2 others.
I hope they allow to turn them of or adjust the brightness in the future.
But it's not a huge deal as it is under my desk.
I just push my chair in front of it at night and it's not a bother.
"Love it, just want I didn't know I needed."
"Sweat cleans off easy, not hard to install and the included eye cover is functional."
I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam.
It bounces on my face less ands doesn't require as much tension.<br />2.
This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam.<br />Negatives:<br />1.
"There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but it's not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes."
I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue.<br />2.
"The nose piece doesn't stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose."
"It's still rubber so it's not painful, but there has to be a better solution."
Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible.
"If you remove it there is a lot of open area in your lower vision.<br /><br />Overall I recommend it over a silicone cover for the stock foam, but it has a lot of downfalls so I am sure this isn't the best option for a new face plate."
Great bright white color and solid connections.
The combs are very difficult to install but it's worth it for those truly clean aesthetics.
Runs well and seems solid.
My only complaint is when it winds up to full speed it's a bit loud and when it's at full load it gets hot with the stock fan curve.
Stays below 60 when fans are blasting though.
Product was not working on arrival but company was quick to refund
Was surprised how much air it put out.
Small enough to slip into a pocket or my purse.
Happy with my purchase.
Very happy with this alarm.
Easy to install and easy instructions.
Thinking of purchasing 2 more.
For the price of these I couldn't believe the quality sound that they produced.
"Bought a new TV for the family room and it didn't have the input that came with our WII. this product was a perfect solution, and very inexpensive.<br /><br />The product plugs into the WII and then you plug in an HDMI cable from the adapter to the TV."
Couldn't be easier and worked like a charm.
This was a pretty good case for the money.
Buy it's quite a bit louder than I expected.
A good case for the price.
"I was nervous that it would not be roomy enough to fit my Sapphire R9 280X GPU, but it did."
"However, it is not big enough to fit 2 of them in crossfire, so when that day comes, this case will no longer suit my needs."
"Otherwise, it is everything I need in a case."
I needed an inexpensive external drive for my new laptop.
"As it is not something I use often, i didn't want to spend a lot of money on it."
"For what I need, this was the perfect product."
I plugged it in and it worked right out of the box.
"No hassle, very easy."
"I am sure if I was using this more, i may find a more expensive solution would be a better fit, but for what I need- this was perfect."
"They lose audio for like .5 seconds, every 20 minutes, I also thought the ear shape would be useful but it actually hurts my ear somewhat, If i use for more than an hour"
It’s exactly what is says it is.
You connect it to your phone via Bluetooth and it’ll play your phone sound over the radio.
It automatically connects when in range.
The sound quality is good and it’s more or less initally easy to figure out how to use
Haven't gotten them installed yet..
I'm a 68 year old woman and I sat tv in the floor to watch... my daughter helped me but no legs yet...so u cant go by me.. my brother showed them to me but he lives in wv I'm in sc...
"As expected, Glyph products function as expected out of the box with the necessary connections included."
This is a neat appearing outlet extender that functions as promised.
I wish I had learned about it sooner.
"Very simple design, good quality and support for a laptop."
THIS IS A SMALL SLEEK MOUSE THAT DOES A FINE JOB.
"IT IS WIRED, A FEATURE NEEDED TO ACCESS CERTAIN BLUETOOTH ACTIONS."
The product looks good and should protect the keyboard.
"However, removing it from the packaging was difficult."
"This is a higher-priced External Hard Drive, but based on previous experience it is also a higher-quality item."
"For external drives that save important data, quality is most important."
It works as promised.
I bought mine as a combined item with Echo.
"As a stand alone plug, it seems expensive."
Not much beter information that Amazon provides.
"Looks good, works well, and the solar power is a welcome feature."
Have used Bose Wave Music system for years and have been well satisfied with the quality of sound for its size.
It will transfer TV programming to an iMac.
But it requires an app to send the TV programming on the iMac to an iPad on the same WiFi system.
Functions as it should.
Riding out hurricanes is not something I would recommend.
"Some folks though, stay, and this little gizmo not only has a hand crank, but solar pac as well."
Covers all the bases .
Was a gift and was much appreciated.
Everybody should have one for back up.
Tuff little storage box.
There is a constant commercial on the home screen to try and get you to buy a new book.
The charging usb was absurdly short with no adapter.
"Battery life for me is maybe a day, I like to use headphones with audible books and listen to when I am doing housework or yard work."
"It is only as good as your wifi. so if your wifi is spotty, so will your download."
"For the money I paid and the promises made, not worth it."
Well made bag which will only get better the older it gets.
"Love it, my grandson was thrilled with this bag when I gave it to him. people who saw it, believed it cost way more than it did. great purchase."
I have had to use my extended warranty with Square Trade for my grandson's ipad three times now.
Even after the 3'd time I've had to make a claim and they are just as friendly and easy to work with as the first claim.
Never give a kid an electronic device without purchasing the warranty plan from Square Trade.
"It is not a matter of whether you will use it or not, but how often you will use it."
Purchased an ipad for 10year old grandson along with the most sturdy case I could find.
Wisely purchased the 3 year protection plan and had to take advantage of it twice so far.
"Once I filed my claim, a label was emailed to me so I could mail the ipad to them for repair."
"Quick turn around, grandson happy!"
I would wholeheartedly recommend this company to anyone.
"Not worth the money, didn't last at all."
Easy to type on and not to much bigger than the wireless keyboard I was using.
"Best of all, though, I can easily see it."
Keys have a great 'feel' to them.
Wished I would have found this product years ago!
Sound quality is awful!
Sound quality is not good.
Cant even turn it up all the way or it's just that quiet
The case is difficult to open and partially obstructs the camera and corners of the screen.
I would give this negative 0 stars if I could.
Does not work at all.
Shame on you for stealing $10 from unsuspecting people.
I like the sound quality.
It was better than my previous Sony Vaio.
It’s not the best material.
The keys make a sound when I type.
I’m used to silent keys so it’s a little annoying.
I like the touch screen and the updated Bluetooth function and overall technology with the laptop.
The battery life is solid.
Not the best but not the worst.
I like that it’s lightweight.
"The camera is good, also not the best quality."
I’m used to Dell laptops.
I can’t say it’s as good.
I had a first generation fire stick and upgraded to this one.
It has performed Much Better!
"Nice headphones, CORD IS JUNK VERY DISAPPOINTED, FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR THESE ITS RIDICULOUS THAT THE QUALITY IS SO POOR"
"I love these, they hold up to a lot of wear, including me washing them by accident in the washing machine."
"They have 2 sets of the the poertion that goes in the ear,so you can get a good fit."
They are comfortable and a great price
"A little hard to program and get used to, I didnt realize you could set it to which alarms you wanted to hear, and I was missing thunderstorm warnings, but I finally figured that out."
I like the separate speakers it makes it easier to hear around the house.
No issues with reception
Good to weatherproof your outdoor plugs.
Does the job and the length I wanted for my car.
The USB ports didn't work at all and that is what I bought it for.
Thanks it was just what I needed
This product is great!
Started to oy work every once in awhile.
I would have to unplug the cord and try to arrange it just right for it to work.
Exactly what I wanted to use at the ballgames!
"Great quality, fast delivery."
"[[VIDEOID:55e63d40d07e5f34fa19aaeb1b6df5cf]] I used it few times, then after that wouldn’t work at all."
I read all directions and charged up my earbuds.
I turned on my blue tooth and the earbuds wouldn't pair.
This is a reasonably priced wireless mouse.
Fits well in my hand and is super easy to maneuver.
"I have been using this mouse for over a month now and I have to admit, it's one of the nicest mice I have ever used."
I do a lot of spreadsheet details for work and this mouse is quick and accurate.
Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new mouse.
I purchased myself a new Kindle during Black Friday sales on Amazon.
Almost immediately I noticed fingerprints all over the screen.
I found this cleaner and wanted to try it .
"I will say, it did clean the face of the Kindle well, got rid of the fingerprints."
I love the cleaning cloth that it comes with.
I also tried this on my laptop and it also worked well.
I wish this came in a smaller size so I could carry it in my purse (they should have included a small bottle that you could refill for portability).
"Outside of that, for the money you can't do better."
This fits my new Kindle (which I received as a Christmas gift) perfectly.
I love the color and the way my Kindle fits so nice and snug inside.
This is a great addition as it protects my device nicely and I can easily slip my device in my hobo bag for carrying around without fear of damage or scratching.
This is a super nice transistor radio.
"I love the large LED display, is visible from very far away (and with my eyesight is a great feature)."
Antenna really pics up neighboring stations easily and clearly.
I was in the market for a quality battery operated radio to have around my house in the event of a power outage (I am in rural Florida and this happens quite often).
Highly recommend this radio for anyone in the market for one.
I live in a rural area of Florida where most power lines are unfortunately above ground.
We quite often lose electric and in a storm sometimes it can be terrifying.
This is great transistor radio that I always keep near my bedside so I can turn it on in a moments notice for weather and news updates.
Battery powered to me means that I will always have contact with the outside world for updates regardless of whether I have power or not.
Sound quality is clear and it picks up all major stations for me.
I live in Florida and I have been looking for a good transistor radio to use when the power may go out.
This radio is great.
"It is not only an AM/FM radio, but also a shortwave radio, too."
"Sound quality is great, reception picks up easily in my home."
It is definitely piece of mind for anyone who may be in an area prone to power outages.
I wanted a rechargeable mouse that I could use when I am traveling for work.
"This is a small, lightweight, rechargeable mouse that allows me to not have to carry batteries with me."
I really do like the size and the way it feels in my hand when I use it.
"It's not 'silent' as it claims, but I really don't care about that."
"For the money, this is a great little mouse."
This is a really nice plug/surge protector.
"It fits a lot of plugs, without taking up a lot of room."
Hugs the outlet and even has a handy shelf on it for me to lay my phone during a charge.
I use this on the wall next to my bed so I can charge my cell phone and be able to easily reach if I need it.
This would make a unique Christmas present to the person who has everything.
Really nice optical mouse.
Ergonomically fits in my hand and makes maneuvering with my computer easy.
Keeps up with my speedy laptop use.
"Lightweight, but well made."
"I also really love this gold color, gives me a little bling in home office."
Highly recommend this as a reasonably priced wireless mouse for all uses.
This is a really nice wireless keyboard and mouse.
Sets up quickly and easily (which for someone like me who is in her sixties and is somewhat technically challenged) is saying a lot.
This mouse has a great shape and is ergnomically built for easy handheld performance.
"The keyboard is nice, too, standard keyboard but in a compact size."
I love the wireless aspect of this and the fact that the charge is via the usb port.
Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new combo set.
I was looking for an adapter to connect my old VHS player so we could watch some older family movies.
"Within minutes of receiving this, I was able to connect my VHS player to my television and we were watching movies."
"I am not technically savvy, so for me to say this was easy to do is really saying something."
Highly recommend if you are in the market for an adapter.
This vertical power strip is amazing.
"No only does it have lots of places to plug in, but it also has usb ports."
"I love the fact that this is vertical, takes up so much less space and keeps all my cords super organized."
"I already have ordered a second one to use in my bedroom (between my Alexa, my white noise machine, lamp, alarm clock and phone plug (traditional) I really need a way to organize the wires behind my side table."
Highly recommend this to everyone.
Would also make a great gift for a student or person for office use.
I like the size of this watch and the display and functionality features.
I am deducting a point for set up.
I had a heck of a time trying to get it to pair with my phone's bluetooth.
I did look out here to research it and looked at the only one star review and saw someone had the same problem.
"After about 20 minutes pf putzing around with this, I did get it to pair (no idea how it happened, it just magically did)."
"Anyway, now that it is working, I really like it and am wearing it daily."
Great way to track my movements.
This was a perfect power strip for me for use in my bedroom.
"My nightstand has several items on it (Alexa, phone charger, lamp, white noise machine) and I only have a two outlet wall unit."
"This power strip is great, it only has a 4 ft. cord which makes it perfect for my arrangement (so no lengthy bulky cord) and everything fits in well."
I also love the design and color.
"Although you can't see it behind my nightstand, it has a great textured look to it and it is crisp and clean."
If you are in the market for a shorter length power strip this unit would be great for you.
Wasn't sure what this actually would do when I got it.
I set it up and in minutes I heard an amazing difference in my Sony headphones!
Quality is probably twice as what is was before.
Highs and lows are way improved and the clarity is amazing.
I highly recommend everyone who uses headphones to try an amplifier.
"For the price, this is an amazing improvement!"
"Basic wired earbuds, a step up from what you would get on an airplane to watch their movies with."
"Good bass, decent treble."
"To be honest, most of my earbuds now are Bluetooth and wireless so I will not have a longterm use for these, but will keep them around to use with my laptop or my old school ipod."
"Not sure what the price of these are (web page is currently showing as unavailable), so I can't comment on the value."
Recommend these if you are in the market for a set of wired buds.
I needed a wireless speaker I could use on my lanai in Florida.
"Wasn't sure, despite the overall great reviews, how good this would really be."
"All I can say is 'Wow, wow, wow!'."
"The bass is strong, the overall sound quality is amazing and it was super easy to set up and start using."
"I am a 60 year old woman and sometimes I can be technically challenged, but this unit was quickly paired and blasting."
"I am very happy with this speaker and, for the money, is comparable to the most costly speakers on the market."
"Compact travel adapter, nice to carry with you on your journeys."
I travel quite often to European countries and this adapter will work in every country I will be visiting.
"No need to have a more clunky model or multiple adapters in your house, this unit will work in over 100 countries."
"Highly recommend as a way to ease your travel, just keep it in your suitcase at all times so you always have it with you."
This is a great stabilizer device.
I use it with my Sony A7III mirrorless camera and it works great.
Compact and lightweight and it does the job.
"Get professional results using this, even if you are only using (like me) for my amateur picture taking."
"I highly recommend this Zhiyun Weebill Lab gimbal, perfect for professional or amateur use."
Not much to say about this cable.
"Works great, reasonably priced."
I really love Amazon basics products as you normally get a high quality product at a great price.
This phone charger is no exception.
"Works great, charges quickly, highly recommended."
"Great basic mouse, comes in a variety of colors."
No issues at all with it.
Easy to connect and easy to use.
Fits well in my hands and maneuvers well.
For less than $8.00 it's a great mouse to use for your computing needs.
I love these wireless Shure earphones.
"In the morning when I go for my walkout with my dog, they are a staple with my attire and allow me to listen to my audio books without the hassle of wires connected to my iphone."
"Shure has been a staple to me since I was in my twenties (I actually used to be in a band and had Shure microphones), so I can testify to the quality of the Shure name (I like their sound quality better than my Bose headphones at about a third of the price)."
These are noise isolating and will work wonderfully for air travel as well.These would make a great Christmas gift for someone you love.
"Usually I am pretty tech savvy, but some of this I couldn't figure out (and the TrackR help on line doesn't seem to have the answer)."
I wanted this because of Alexa capabilities.
I planned to use this on my keys.
"Instructions told me to set it up with my cell phone, so I figured I needed to do that first."
I finally connected my phone to my Ipad TrackR app.
"Of course, I got Alexa easily to find my phone (and ring it)."
"However, when I tried to use find my phone on my Ipad it rang my Ipad (not my phone) so, I will now have to go back to square one with that."
"But, again, my original intent was to use with my keys."
"I did get that to work with my ipad, but I wanted Alexa to do it as well."
"I cannot get Alexa to find my keys with the TrackR device attached, only my Ipad can do it."
I will do some additional work on this when I have time.
"I wanted Alexa to find my keys, not my Ipad."
"Oh well, so much for technology."
"I love Amazon basics products, particularly when it comes to electronic accessories."
This Ipad Pro case is no exception.
"It fits my 9&#34;7 Ipad Pro perfectly, streamlined, great leather case and gives me the protection I need in carrying this around with me."
The magnetic fold keeps my Ipad covered and keeps the elements out.
"Well made, attractive, reasonably priced, this is a must have for any Ipad owner for every day use."
I absolutely love this Solo Pro Aegis!
"I previously had a beautiful backpack style case that I bought on Amazon last year that, when I looked at it, seemed to be everything I wanted."
"Well, after traveling internationally 3 times in the last 12 months, I needed to get something else."
"I found the fact that I would have to juggle suitcase, purse and backpack while going through customs, airports, etc, it just became impossible."
I found myself unable to put the backpack on once I was getting through the lines so I ended up holding it most of the time which was just awful.
This new Solo is fantastic.
"It is easy to swing over my shoulder, leaving my hands free."
"It's also so much thinner than my backpack, but with what seems to be far more storage capabilities than my old one."
"Pockets galore, padded beautifully, plenty of room for my 15&quot; laptop, bluetooth keyboard, mouse along with my Ipad pro and accessories."
"Also has plenty of room for other stuff as well (papers, etc)."
On top of it all it has extra security for me to feel safe in keeping my credit cards and other identity items close to me and with a security block.
I couldn't be happier!
"Well, I have kind of given up on setting this up."
"First, I must admit I am a 50 something technically challenged woman (often times), so maybe it was just me."
I easily was able to download the apps and get it to work with my IPhone.
It was cool asking Siri to turn it on and off.
I really wanted this for Echo and Alexa.
"Try as I might, I couldn't do it."
I downloaded Wink and synced Alexa with Wink.
And then synced IHome with Wink.
Could not get Alexa to find the smart plug at all (and I spent hours today on and off trying to do this).
I will try again tomorrow.
"However, I will tell you nothing is easy with this."
I found no instructions for use with Alexa in the package and had to surf the web for solutions.
Seems like a lot of work to be able to simply turn on a light with my phone.
"Also, I could not get Siri to do this remotely (while I was out and about), so I assume it only works if you are in the proximate area for programming."
Seems expensive for what it really gives me.
"Very attractive watch, but as other mention, it's not that easy to set up."
"I had my nephew, on Christmas Eve, get it ready for me."
Took him about an hour painstakingly reading instructions.
"But, once he did, and he showed me, I was ok with it."
"Has a lot of features that I really don't need (I am interested in tracking the miles I run primarily), so I see this watch primarily for a 20 or 30 something who love new gadgets."
"I personally, prefer my old Fitbit, but that's only because I am not the techy type."
I have been using this unit non-stop for the last 3 days now and I will say it tracks mileage perfectly and I like the on-line experience as well.
Only rating it 4 stars because of it's slight complexity in set up and use.
Great relatively inexpensive television.
I did not have any kind of line at the bottom (which one of the other reviewers had experienced).
This is a very light set and I was easily able to maneuver the box inside and set up all by myself.
The picture is crystal clear and the contrast is simply remarkable at a price like this.
I set this up in my bedroom and was super impressed with the quality of this Polaroid television.
"I am sure the reason for the lightweight feature of this television may largely be due to plastic pieces, but I don't notice it when set up."
"I also find the sound quality of this set impressive, too (no need for me to attach my sound bar)."
"All and all, very impressed."
"If the price on this goes down even further over the holidays, I would jump on it."
"I will be keeping my out for the sales as I would love to get one for my son.<br /><br />10-04-2015 Update: After initially setting this television up in my bedroom, I moved it to my guest bedroom and hadn't used it again until last night."
"Upon my brother's turning on the television, there was a 2 inch yellow band/line with a blue dot across the top (see picture below)."
"So, now I have a television that can't be used."
I need to look into warranty/return policies and have written to Amazon about it.
Absolutely great for the money stereo receiver.
"I hooked this up to two Bose outdoor speakers and my neighbors must be pitching fits, lol."
"Sound quality is great, easy to set up."
Bought this camera in 2010 and I am still using it today.
"Great little, takes great pictures, is compact and versatile."
You can rely on the Pentax name for quality and durability.
I have been meaning to write this review for upwards of a year now.
"Was using the camera yesterday and realized I needed to write it, so here I am."
Absolutely the best camera I ever owned (I even enjoy and use it more than my Canon Rebel).
"It is compact, attractive and takes some of the best quality pictures I have ever taken."
"I know this is a model that may not be readily available, but look for it on the secondary market."
It's a great find and is the perfect camera.
"Great mouse, ergonomically fits my hand perfectly."
Battery has lasted in this now for months (I received this back in January and haven't had to replace yet).
"I love Kensington products, you can depend on the name and the quality."
"Great little device, works with almost all gadgets (I have paired it with my Ipad, Ipod and Samsung laptop, in addition to my IPhone 5)."
"I wish it had been easier to install on my own (I needed to get it done professionally), so it did cost me $129 to get it set up."
"But, what a great device, and my grandkids absolutely love it."
I like the idea of something like this bluetooth enabled device in lieu of having monitors for tv/movie viewing in a minivan.
Not much else to say (I have read most of the other reviews and I agree wholeheartedly).
Picture/monitor is hi-def and entertained my grandkids watching a movie while I drove from my home in PBG to Orlando last weekend.
Gave it to my 28 year old son to try first (as I can sometimes be technically challenged).
It was easy to set up an within minutes he was using it (to the delight of his 5 year old daughter).
No complaints except for the battery life.
Didn't seem like he used it for more than an hour that he had to recharge.
I think Parrot should do something to extend on this if they expect to attract a sizeable crowd purchasing same.
I will say that it would make a great gift to give the person who seems to have everything as it is clever and definitely a conversation piece.
Holiday giving would work especially to be under the tree for the difficult to buy for sure.
I would just keep in mind the battery life.
"As a closing comment, I am now the proud owner of this minidrone and I must admit this 50 something women just loves to play with it (to this dismay of my cat who would love to get her paws on this, lol)"
I used this mound for a television in my new house in my bedroom.
It was easy to install and I think it's great that I don't have a television stand cluttering up my bedroom.
I should've done this years ago in my old house.
Understand that I am not technical at all and I was easily able to set this up right out of the box.
Nice easy wall-mounted makes the walls look clean television looks almost transparent hanging with no wires hanging.
"I love how easily the television adjusts I can pull it out push it back turn it, it''s just perfect for my room."
And it's also a great deal.
I highly recommend this.
Not much can be said that hasn't been said in other reviews.
Biggest plus on this is that it is a 3.0 Flash Drive and the manufacturer is Toshiba.
Downside is the size and the price.
"It does the job well, uploads were quick, I have no complaints at all."
4 stars primarily because I think you can do better with a comparable drive at a lower price (you are paying for the name here).
I have to say that this does fit my needs.
"I am using this for a television, blu-ray and surroundsound set up."
The three foot cord is perfect and does not clutter up the floor with too much cord.
I love the fact that this came with an extension cord (as I needed one that matches).
I don't agree with the others upset about the 6 ft extension not working with the surge protector as a problem.
It is actually not meant for that purpose.
"For my use, this is perfect and you can depend on the Belkin name for a quality surge protector."
"This is a great, reasonably priced FM Transmitter.I have been using it now for a few weeks with my Iphone 5S."
Still a little confused off the need for this with all the radio applications (i.e.
Radio Pup) that allows users to tune in to most stations.
"I guess if your station does not subscribe to a service, then the need for a transmitter will come into play."
Sound is good (contrary to what other reviewers had said). and I had no trouble with quality of transmission.
Not sure why all the negative reviews on this Logitech item.
All I can think of is that there were problems initially with the cover which Logitech corrected in a later release.
"Anyway, I love this cover."
I find it protects my IPad Air oerfectly and looks sharp and sleek.
"The keyboard itself is neatly inside and, when opened, allows for a feeling that you are typing on a traditional full size keyboard."
"Although not inexpensive by any means, it is a great tool to use particularly when doing a lot of typing (I hate using the keyboard on the screen)."
I highly recommend this to everyone.
"Like I said, I could find no fault with the cover/case an it performs as it should."
"First for pros: This is tiny, maybe about 3/4 inch thick at it's widest."
"Sleek, attractive and would probably delight any techie who is looking for some kind of new hip gadget."
For the cons: It's too small.
There are no indentations to grip the mouse and it is difficult to click on any area that you are trying to.
"Navigation/movement of the mouse is ok, it's the clicking that is difficult to do (and it becomes quite annoying to say the least)."
"Within using this for a full day I, unfortunately, reverted back to my old wireless HP mouse."
"Maybe I am just old school and set in my ways (I am in my 50's), so I will be 'loaning' this to my techie son to give it a go."
Maybe he will appreciate this better and will be able to navigate easier than I could.
"If that is the case, I will revisit my review and update accordingly."
"I will start by saying I have an Omnimount tv mount and when I saw the sound bar mount in Vine, I was very excited to say the least."
"It is, naturally, a perfect match for wall mounted Panasonic 42"" television in the Omnimount."
"It was easy to install (so easy, I was able to do it myself, someone who is usually shy of doing any kind of DIY activities."
I love the way it fits and it looks like a professional mounting job all around.
I highly recommend this sound bar mount (I am using it with my large Bose) especially if you buy it as a companion to the Omnimount television mounting system.
I already have a Bose system (worth about $1500) that I use in my living room.
I was looking for a system for use in my family room with a new 3D television I had bought around Super Bowl time.
"I got the Sony BDV-N7100W system and I can honestly say that at about a third of the price of the Bose, the Sony excels with sound quality."
I love the wireless speakers and have them spread out over about a 25 ft. area.
The sound is incredible with strong lows and highs.
The 3D Blu-ray player is also flawless in quality and completes my home theater system to a T.
My teenage sons absolutely love this system and are spending more time now in the family room than the living room (solely for the reason on using the Sony).
"For the price, this Sony system can not be beat."
"The quality is wonderful, it's attractive and compact."
"Not a bad thing to say about the system, go for it."
I am a little disappointed with the quality of this point and shoot.
"First, the pros are that it is light, attractive, small and easy to carry."
"Everything else, in my opinion, really revolves around what you get for the money."
"Quality of the pictures is just ok, I honestly think my Apple iphone takes better pictures (even in dimly lit areas)."
"But for those people who want to take a lot of pictures on a trip and need memory card, then a camera would be a must have."
"Not crazy about the zoom capability, seems to definitely be less than advertised."
"As I mentioned, in low lighting camera stabilization seems low."
"Overall, if this was in a gold box deal for $99 I would jump on it for the name and durability of a Sony product."
But not for $20-30 more than that.
I think you can do better.
"Fits well, protects well and is an attractive cover for my 7"" Kindle."
If there was any downside it's the smell.
I hate that faux leather smell.
"I am thinking that over time, hopefully, it will lose the plastic/rubbery smell."
"To be honest, I had a lot of difficulty getting this Screen Protector installed on my Ipad 3."
"I am not sure if it was me or not, although I do some other reviews here where others have said the same thing."
"That said, once it was on I can say that the protection and clarity of the protector is great."
I do have a tendency to mess up screens with my fingerprints and this does relieve me of that.
"I think there are a few glare factors here, though, which is why I rated this as a 4 and not a 5 star product (in combination with the difficulty of application)."
"The Verso ""Profile"" standing cover for Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" fits my Kindle snuggly, is attractive and works as designed in a standing mode (I actually watched a movie using the Kindle an this cover stand last weekend)."
"It's attractive, but you can tell it's not leather (very vinyl looking and does have a vinyl smell to it)."
"However, it is solid product and protects the Kindle well.I like the black since it goes with everything."
"As has been stated in previous reviews, there are pros and cons for these earphones."
"First, they are attractive looking (a little on the masculine side) and they come with three alternate buds to be able to adjust them to the ones who fit you best)."
"Second, the sound is good, bass is phenomenal, so the discerning headphone user will not be disappointed with the quality of the Moshi Vortex."
"I found these to still be a little large for my ears, at least weight wise, and I am not comfortable when walking with them in (they are fine if I am sitting in my house listening to music, just not wearing them around in my ears when up and active)."
"I am rating them 4 stars simply because I think the sound quality is excellent, but I think you can do better for your $80 cost in getting a better fitting, lighter pair to be used on the go (as I do when I exercise/walk every morning)."
"Got this Verso for my new 7"" HD Fire."
"I found the color bright and a really neon green, probably a little 'too bright' for a 50 something year old woman."
I honestly think this color (and I assume the alternate pink as well) is better suited for teenagers.
"The case is thin and not very protective, though, so I think the idea of giving this to a teenager there may be better (more protective) alternatives."
I would say go ahead and spen another $10 and get one of the better cases and skip the style/fashion side of a case for your Kindle.
"I was currently an Ipad 4 user, having owned an Ipad 3 previously as well."
"I thought I was sold on Apple until till I purchased my nephew a 7"" Kindle Fire HD for Christmas."
"When he opened the box and began to use it, I was mesmorized with the quality of the picture and the amazing sound."
"Being that I have been a Prime member for years, I began to consider purchasing one for myself so I could benefit from the free Kindle book loans and streaming videos."
"I purchased this 4G LTE 8.9"" version on the Kindle Fire HD and after having used it for several days now non-stop, I assure you that the Ipad is going into the closet (or will be made a gift to one of my neices shortly)."
I could not resist the $49.99 package for 250 mb a month for 12 months along with the $50 credit Amazon was doing as a promotion.
"Surfing the web is easy, speed is amazing, I am just so happy with my purchase."
You honestly can't get a better deal out there.
Let me start by stating that I received this camera as part of the Vine program.
I have used it for almost 2 months now exclusively and this review is based on this.
"I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events, concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket)."
"Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony, the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag, make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel."
"To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1."
"The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot."
"If you are looking for a quality, sleek, stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability), and you have several $100 to spend, then the investment may be worth it for you."
"I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range, then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses."
"I am rating this as a 4 star because, honestly, it's a great camera."
"It's the price, and what you get for it, that has me shaving one star off the rating."
"When I saw this RCA charging dock, I jumped to get it."
"Normally, I work from home and use one or two plugs to keep all of my Apple items charged throughout the day (rotating them betwen plugs)."
"When I saw this charging dock, I thought it would be a great way to connect my iphone, keep it upright for viewing ease, and keep the phone charged all day long."
"First, although the picture looks good, the item is cheaply made plastic, which I guess would normally be ok for something like this (although to me in the picture it looked a little sturdier)."
The 30 point connection does not work well.
I had to rock my phone several times to get it start charging (it wasn't easy to see if it is connected properly).
"Having a charging light on the base would have been a nice-have, but of course there isn't one."
I then tried my ipod in there.
"I found that a little easier to connect, but still takes several attempts of getting it to the right angle to make it work right."
"To be honest, I think it is just a matter of time before this breaks (given the difficulty I have in connecting)."
I would honestly say to spend your money elsewhere.
This item is not worth the investment.
"Powerful and attractive, the SC-AKX73 is an amazing table top stereo system."
"As other reviewers have stated, this is a 900 Watt system (according to the specs) and it is every bit as powerful as that."
"As an fyi, I have a living room in my home which actually has a two story ceiling in it, so lot's of open space."
I only had this unit cranked about a third of the way and I can say the entire room was throbbing.
"Very, very nice and very impressed."
Bass tones are amazing and highs can rival the more costly Bose systems.
"All in all, I highly recommend this system to anyone."
"For the price, you honestly cannot go wrong for the features and quality that the Panasonic brand brings."
I want to begin by saying I own a Canon Rebel which I love and use all the time.
I wanted to get a second camera which also took great pictures but that was lower priced and better for me to take on extended travel without all my lenses).
The Fujifilm FinePix is a good camera.
"For around the $200 price range, you get a high quality camera with good picture taking quality (14 MP, EVF, 30 times zoom capability)."
It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot).
"It is a little large and plasticy, but overall I do recommend it for a good second camera or, as I mentioned, to someone looking to enter the SLR market (but not ready to spend $600+)."
"Great for school dorms or apartments, this Panasonic SC-AKX14 stereo delivers great bass and sound quality."
It's attractive and sizable (not compact) and would impress most of the younger set.
I think this would make a great present this Christmas to students in college as it would truly rock (especially given its strong wattage) the dorm house.
I called this 'old school' because it reminds me a bit of the old boom boxes they used to have around.
"Of course, with today's MP3 players with their compact sizes and use of wireless speakers, the need for a CD player of this size might be slight outdated."
"However, it's sound is impressive and reasonably priced for the quality."
I love this logitech set.
Not sure why some people have less than stellar reviews on this as I have had nothing but positive things to say since I started using it several months back.
"I love the fact that the additional wires that used to support my keyboard and mouse are now gone, leaving my desktop far cleaner and organized."
I tend to leave the mouse and keyboard on 24x7 most of the time (I forget to shut them off) and I have yet to have to change batteries since first setting it up.
"If there were any downside at all, it would be that I honestly wish more vendors would make these keyboards with lit backgrounds (so it is easier to see the keys in poorly lit/morning hours)."
"First for the pros: Beautiful looking, sleek, shiny and artfully designed to fit any style room."
Relatively easy to install (being a non-techy person I actually followed the verbal audio instructions easily and flawlessly).
The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones.
The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose).
"The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc)."
"For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes."
I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better.
"But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure."
The only other con is the price.
If this was in a $700-1000 range I would tell you to snatch it up in a heartbeat.
But for $1500 you are honestly paying for the name (and the status symbol bragging rights to say you own a Bose system).
Wait for the price to come down and grab it.
"You honestly won't be disappointed with the sound quality nor the set up (and, who knows, maybe it's me in not being able to get the remote to work properly with all my other devices)."
First the disclaimer that I got this in the Vine program.
"That being said, I always try to be fair, honest and objective in my reviews."
"That being said, I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system."
"As the ad specified this was good for small spaces, I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32"" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support)."
Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions).
"Sound is clear, bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small/medium sized room."
"Here are the cons: First, as another reviewer has written, the fan in the bass unit is audible."
Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum.
The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device.
I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen.
"To me, wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system."
I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MME6S4/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic.
Cost half the price of this unit and I honestly prefer it over the Sharp.
"Shop around, this is overpriced for what you can get elsewhere."
The Panasonic SC-HTB15 is a great Home Theater System.
It was unfortunate that I was not able to install this myself due to the way my current Panasonic Viera television is set up (it was wall mounted by a professional) so I needed to call in someone to do this for me.
I watched the tech set it up and seemed to be relatively easy to do (once he was able to get to the wall mounted television).
If I had the television on a standard table mount I am sure I coud have easily set this up myself.
"Once installed, all I can say is 'Wow' to the quality of the sound."
"The technician set up the speakers similar to the way it is displayed on the Amazon page, one on each side of the television wall mounted."
"To me, the sound rivaled any 4 speaker system out there and fro, the second it was turned on, filled my entire room with beautiful crystal clear sound."
If there were any drawbacks at all it would be that I wish the system was wireless (so I didn't have to go through the expense of the installation).
"But, as I mentioned, I do have a wall mount which is my own drawback I guess."
I would recommend this system to anyone to use in a family room or living room with a large screen tv (I love the Viera model so I am slightly prejudiced when it comes to the Panasonic name).
Got this in the Vine program to compliment the IPad2 I had bought a few months back.
"It is adhesive backed which, in my opinion, does not make it the easiest to use device."
"I had thought we could use it for my Kindle cookbook collection, which I have."
"However, once it was set into place, it was not adjustable (so my husband and kids couldn't easily view it at their heights for other purposes)."
This would have been far better designed to have strong magnets so you could adjust it for everyone's needs.
"Outside of this, the fridge mount worked as designed and is easily set up."
Just think they should have thought the design of this through better.
Let me start by saying I got the Philip's Gogear as part of the Vine program.
"I have always used an Ipod, so this was new for me."
I really had serious issues with using this device.
First for the positives: it's an attractive size and the display is clear.
"On the downside, I found it difficult to navigate."
"I also experience, while running, the jostling of the settings (meaning that all of a sudden it skipped to the next song)."
"I had a real problem with that, so I stopped using it."
Figure I can give the device to a kid or someone who doesn't jog or require any kind of non-static device.
"So, I rated this two stars thinking that maybe someone who doesn't exercise and is simply listening to music might have a use for this, but I am returning to my Apple."
"To be honest, I got my IPAD about 2 months ago and purchased a bluetooth keyboard case (from Amazon of course)."
"I was finding it to be a bit cumbersome to travel locally with, like going to the stores (although I admit it is nice to be able to type on a keyboard)."
"Anyway, I was looking for an alternative case to be able to use as just a case (nothing to do with a keyboard)."
I saw this offered to me in Vine and figure I could give it an honest review.
"To start with, I didn't know if I would like the red plaid design of the cover."
It is just gorgeous and I am so happy I got this.
It looks smart (for either a man or a woman).
The cover in general is padded and my IPAD2 is well protected.
Inside there is a secure holders which snuggly fits my IPAD and on the alternate side on the cover is a side pocket for document storage and an elastic band which will keep any other items in place (i.e. a small calculator etc).
I would see this as a great accessory for a business person who would like a little bit of storage with their case and it behaves almost like a small portfolio case.
The back corner of the cover has a perfectly fit hole which allows you to continue to use the camera feature while the IPAD 2 stays snug in the case.
I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the Marco cover.
"It looks smart and protects my IPAD2, all while giving me some handy side features."
To top it all off it has the Smart magnetic feature which puts the IPAD to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened (saves battery life).
"I highly recommend, this is a great cover for all!!!"
"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that when I was in my 20's I owned a great SLR camera and dragged it around with me everywhere."
"I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'."
I was a 'professional' amateur.
"Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets."
"I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability."
I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag).
"Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR."
"Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel."
All I can say is 'wow'!
"I love it, love it, love it."
"Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself)."
"The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time."
"I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again."
I have also gotten into wildlife and nature pictures and some of the pictures I have taken of flowers could match up with any professional photographer.
"If you are in the market for a compact SLR, this is the camera to buy!"
"I love the Transcend cards, have always bought them for my cameras."
"I find that, dollar for dollar, they are the best value and quality than any other card on the market."
I own a Canon Rebel and take a lot of pictures.
"To me, the optimum size is this 8GB for storage."
"I usually take two of these cards with me when I go on vacation and, although I take a ton of pictures, usually still come back with some room on the cards."
I highly recommend this brand and size of memory card for any amateur photographer out there.
"You won't find a card like this, at this quality and reliability, for under $13 anywhere else."
"I hike at least once or twice a year, and usually into areas which are not clearly marked or travelled by many people."
I am thrilled to have gotten this Magellan as a member of the Vine program.
"I used it this past weekend, just walking in my neighborhood park."
Let me start by saying it is super easy to set up (batteries) and programming the destinations (although maybe it's simply because I have been using a variety of GPS systems over the past 5 years or so in cars and handheld).
"This item is perfect for carrying in a pocket, is very lightweight and is extremely user friendly."
I used it locally here all last weekend (various places in NJ and Pennsylvania) and it functioned beautifully.
Of course the true test will be when I travel to Montana in May and use it in the wilderness.
But I am excited with its potential!!!
Got this MP3 player as part of the Amazon Vine program.
"My older Ipod was just about ready to be replaced, so I thought that this would be a good alternative."
"Well, sound quality is really good, which I liked."
"Earbuds, as has been mentioned in other reviews, are far superior to the ones that come standard from the Ipod."
"I didn't like the screen display, too small for these 50 year old eyes."
"All in all, it's ok, which is why I gave it 4 stars."
It does what it needs to do.
"But, to be honest, if I was going to spend $140 on an MP3 player, I would much rather go with the Apple."
