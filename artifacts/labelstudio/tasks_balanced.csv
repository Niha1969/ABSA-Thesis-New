"I do not like how these new version have adjustable ear loops, I wear them all day at work and when someone speaks and I pull it out the ear loop stretches out and I have to fix it constantly"
"I bought this for my grandson 2 years ago (although it doesn't show as a verified purchase for some reason). He loves it. I'd give it a 5 star rating if not for one complaint and it's a big one. THE DARNED MICRO-B USB PORT! The first year he had it, he went through two chargers and had to have the tablet replaced once because of his little 4 year old hands trying to force the stupid ONE-WAY CABLE into the little slot. I think this is a design flaw, when even my adult devices (except for Amazon devices) have a MICRO-C USB--which has no right way or upside down way. Why on earth would you make a device for kids like that? I know. Don't let them plug it in. You try telling a 5 year old who says, &#34;I can do it&#34; that &#34;No. You can't.&#34; Well, at 6, he's finally learned to plug it in and makes sure I know that there is an upside-down. Really, Amazon? Can't you fix this?"
"I have ordered other bands for my Fitbit 2, but these have been the best quality and the best value."
"Eh, not what I was expecting, and ultimately didn’t work for the purpose I had hoped for which was to store my echo dot out of the way. I returned it."
The cameras have good clairty. But batteries are suppose to last 2 years? I've only has them operating a couple of weeks and already need to change them in the camera by my front door.<br />Dont like that I have to delete clips individually. Would be easier if I could batch delete.  They do gave a good range in the camera fish eye lens.<br />Decent cameras for the money. But powering with out USB is not not performing as stated.
"It lags on my computer when I try to overlay more than one clip. This is with 8GB ram and a nice processor.<br /> There's a crackling sound in the audio that I can't get rid of.<br /> The aspect ratios are really stupid. 16:9 is usually good for YouTube, but it's all screwed up once I upload it.<br /> It lowers the quality of the videos. Doesn't matter what format you render it in.<br /> I'm unimpressed."
"It is heavy and large.  The motor is rather loud but it's not like the motor is on all the time - just when opening/closing the screen for use.  It's the screen itself that is the biggest issue as far as I'm concerned.  It is like flimsy material, not the sturdy, stiff and very bright white projector screens of those found at school.  Because it is flimsy material, it cannot project a crisp, clear image.  It's not horrible, but considering what this  should be, the material seems like a failed choice by the manufacturer thinking it would save money and what it has done is lower the quality to the point I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Not easy to get the apps you need because Google interferes all the time.
The cable didnt last as long as I would have hoped but you get five in the pack so it cuts the difference pretty much.
"This does not go in easy.. They need to do more work on the install and recognition of cam Mac-id , it worked better under xp some what, the main consol I could not get set up on ether pc with Xp or Win7.. They need updates for thiis type of install. I got the camera working in the moble aps after a one time shot at instll on an old XP machine..Not sure ehat the problem is.. I could not get the capture on the card when in the camera to take a snap shot and save it to the card.. The picures look great now if only the software would work in sysnc with the machines I have."
No improvement whatsoever. Didn't strengthen signal regardless of where it was set.
My mom doesn't see well any more so the remote was always a challenge. Then I found this. Problem solved.
"I thought at first… “Yeah this is great”. Good fit, same color, snaps on and stays on”. Then, 1 month later, I’m sitting down at the bar and the clip breaks. I think, “well shoot, I’m glad I had a protecting cover on the watch”. But then I looked at the watch and saw the clip on protecting layer actually rubbed the watch clean of anything it was supposed to protect against! If I didn’t have this product on my watch, my watch would look better and not be all scratched up. My disappoint is immeasurable and my sadness knows no bounds"
"I’m sure it won’t be everyone’s experience, but it was a good test for these earbuds.  My grandson listens to music while plowing the field, and he assures me that he hears good, pure music  and that tractor noise is non-existent!  They are comfortable to wear, and the noise cancellation is amazing.  Good choice!"
Pros<br />1. Good soud quality and noise cancellation<br />2. Made of good materials<br />Cons<br />1. The fit is poor and constantly need to adjust during jogging
"I waited for the weather to warm up before I installed this. Big mistake... I missed the return window. Instructions regarding the wiring are sparse - but straightforward to figure out if you’ve wired stuff in the past. Took me a couple of hours of interior trim removal and replacement but the wiring part was done within 20 minutes. Worked for less than a week. Dismantled trim again and checked all wiring connections, but I’m no longer getting any video when I shift into reverse. What a piece of junk! Not sure why this is a big seller with decent ratings."
There are both beautiful cards and funny cards. This is the best sticker set I have ever bought!
Received these as a gift.  They worked beautifully for about a month & then all of a sudden stopped pairing with my iPhone and will no longer pair no matter what I try.
"Good sound, great battery life, but way too big for the ear. They create a lot of ear fatigue for me."
A cable is just a cable. This one does exactly what I bought it for.
"They sound pretty good. The build quality sadly didn't hold out through the 2 year warranty mark. The V plates broke and screws came lose and no amount of tape or glue helps put it back together. These were used as gaming headsets so they didn't see much action outside of my desk or exposed to elements, so they definitely weren't in unfavorable circumstances. This is also an issue a friend of mine who purchased an M100 shared so it's not just me sadly.<br /><br />They sound great overall, they pack a lot of bass but it does level out over time as you burn the headphones in. My biggest gripe is the build quality though especially considering its a selling point of these, the headband has weak points that need addressing in the next iteration  (the V plates/adjusting band.)"
Dimensions listed on the page are wrong.
I got this so I could elevate the screen of my MacBook to my eye level.  (My daughter insists I have bad posture and this will help.). The stand is very adjustable and holds the laptop perfectly.  I was able to raise it so it's now eye level.  I have a bluetooth keyboard and tracking pad that I use with the laptop.  The keyboard fits nicely under the laptop for when I'm not working.  Overall I'm very pleased with this stand and would highly recommend it.
My daughter loves her case & the fit was perfect.
"This only comes with the metal rig. I wouldn't have ordered this if I had known it was just the metal rig, doesn't really seem that great of a deal IMO.:/"
"It works fine. Sometimes during the day it says unable to connect, I wait a few hours and it comes back. The picture quality isnt great but I use it to keep an eye on my dogs when they are home alone so it serves its purpose. Easy to use."
"Our old Victorian house has lots of quirks, one of them being a lack of electrical outlets. In order to manage our 21st century lifestyle in a 19th century home, we have had to make some adjustments until we can remodel. Remodeling takes time, and we have electronics to use now!<br /><br />There is usually only one outlet per room, which means power strips. LOTS OF POWER STRIPS. And fancy power strips with surge protection are three-pronged (grounding wire). Most of our existing outlets are two-pronged, so we needed a 3-to-2 conversion.  This pack of compact adapters solves our immediate problem, until we can get an electrician in to safely rewire the whole house."
Very well made. They have quality connectors on the ends. They're covered with sturdy materials which protects the wires on the inside. The connectors are connected to the wires with reinforced extensions to minimize the possibility of coming loose. Great product for the person who either needs a long distance from computer to printer or monitor.
"This thumb drive is actually amazing. To make up for its steep price, it allows you play and view media on your device, from the drive, which I think is amazing! It also has a surprisingly long battery life, starting at full when I got it and running out HALF WAY the next day, at 2 pm!"
"VAKYOU Air DusterCompressed Air Duster and Vacuum 2-in-1, 3 Speeds Air Blower for Computer Keyboard Car Electronics Home Cleaning,<br /><br />When I ordered this item it was listed as a 2 in 1 vacuum and air duster. When I received this item, the box said “air duster.” It does not have a vacuum, only an air duster. I was wanting and expecting it to also be a vacuum.<br /><br />The air duster works well. It has multiple speeds and puts out a lot of air. It charges via usb c. There are several attachments to direct the air where you want it to go."
"I don't use the sleep tracking because the watch is bulky and annoying while trying to sleep. The mobile app is ok, constantly running in background.  The battery life sucks, only good for a day and sometimes a day and a half which is to bad because I do love all the things it does. I think I can answer my phone on my watch (still figuring out how) can definitely hang up on unwanted calls and can read messages.  Good pedometer and workout tool. Overall nice watch with crappy battery life."
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE> YOU ARE BETTER OFF SPENDING SOME MONEY ON A QUALITY PRODUCT. I HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF THESE THINGS FROM AMAZON OF DIFFERENT BRANDS AND THEY ARE BOTH CHINESE TRASH. THE REMOTE CONTROLS DONT EVEN WORK EXCEPT TO TURN THE THING ON AND OFF. OTHER THAN THAT IT DOES NOT WORK ON EITHER OF THE TWO.
"I couldn't get the microphone to work (light was green) so I had to watch about 4 ""how to get your microphone to work on windows 10"" tutorials on Youtube until one of them actually worked.  I was finally able to test the microphone and could see the sound bar going up and down as I spoke louder and softer into it.  However, no matter  how many tutorials I watched, I could never hear myself through my headset to actually hear the sound quality of the microphone.  So, I don't know if I sound wonderful, super tinny or somewhere in between.  I'll keep working with it but at this point I have to give it a rest for a while.  The little pamphlet included with the microphone is absolutely useless and doesn't offer any troubleshooting."
"This item is made for small diameter tubing...It in no way fits properly  on a larger diamater motorcycle handlebar. Could have bought this item at a brick and morter store cheaper, but from the advertisment, thought it was in between the bike handle bar and roll cage size. Waste of money.."
They last for about 2 weeks and then they don't turn on anymore I'm on my second pair now. Thinking this first pair was just a faulty pair but it was the same with the second pair as well
Cheap expandability for the Nintendo Switch. Games seem to load just about as fast as when they're installed directly on the console.
Right speaker fell off after 6 months and the warranty department is completely useless
"I’m sure I’m not the idea customer for this — there were a lot of settings that I didn’t even attempt to deal with. From my POV - it hooked up pretty easy and worked. I get a good signal, the box doesn’t have a lot of weird antennas and it seems to cover most of my house without having to use range extenders. I did have some flukey connection issues in the beginning but it may have been my less than stellar ISP because it seems to have resolved without doing anything else. Occasionally I seem to get some hiccups but for now, I’ll attribute them to my provider as well, since I had them before."
"Logitech (Logi) states on the product page for this mouse that, ""Laser-grade precision means you’ll enjoy incredibly smooth and accurate tracking and cursor control on just about any surface.""  That is definitely NOT the case with this mouse.  Sometimes I use my laptop just before going to bed, so I place it on the bed sheet.  It does not track smoothly at all on this surface.  I even tried switching to an old mouse pad and the tracking was still bad.  Thankfully I only use this mouse while traveling and while charging my MX Revolution - which works fine on the bed sheet and other surfaces."
"I used this paper inside of an electric motor I was re-winding, in order to protect the coils from the edges of the stator. For this purpose, it worked quite well. I was able to cut it to dimension, fit it into the stator, wrap the windings around it. It took the Super Corona Dope resin I used to secure the coils without any issue, and survived the baking process (at an admittedly modest 220F) without undergoing any changes.<br /><br />I can see now why some of fish paper has adhesive backing - that would have been helpful here. I ended up using spray adhesive, which worked, but I think I would have preferred it the adhesive was just part of the paper instead. Depending on what you are using this for, that may not be of interest.<br /><br />So, basically, would recommend for re-winding a small motor, you get plenty for what you pay and its tough enough to survive the winding with minimum tearing."
"I use this echo dot in my car and it works great.  I have to toggle on/off/on my mobile hotspot every time I get into the car, but after that it connects easily and works well.  I keep it in the center console and it picks up my voice even with it closed."
So I'm updating this.  It was really blurry.  So I took it apart thinking I needed to clean it.  Bit I found removing the spring and gluing the adjustment lens in place after its focused helps with it being blurry.
I can finally run FFXIV without my laptop melting lol
Leaves smears.  Monitor must be cool but still leaves smears
It does make a sound when door or window open but they do not stick very well. We cleaned the area and made sure it was dry. It wouldn’t stick keeps falling down. :(
"I purchased it, in part to download reference books which contain some tables in their content.<br />These tables are not readable, and do not enlarge when the text they are embedded in are enlarged by selecting a larger font.<br /><br />It's good for reading text only. It is a way for me to read in bed before I fall asleep without bothering my husband."
This tile works just as it says. Very useful. And you can share the tile with someone else in your family. It's like getting two for one.
It's a cute gadget but I was a bit disappointed in the size and quality of the photos.  Not the 'old' polaroids of yesteryear.
"Probably would opt for a different product if I had to do it over again. This is my bad, but ALWAYS make sure to test your cables before running them in the wall. I knew that from experience but forgot this time. Had a bad HDMI cable that's just gonna have to stay in the wall. Fortunately, I ran a spare but it's too short for the application, so I'll either need an HDMI extender or run a new cable which I figure will be extremely difficult now that the system is installed.<br />The instructions are pretty poor, mainly low quality pictures without reference to the instructions. Hard to figure out the instructions, but fortunately it's not rocket science. The cutout template is good and the box anchor wings work well - unlike those blue &#34;old work&#34; boxes from HD, which are junk. Probably the worst thing about this is attaching the power cable box cover on the back. It has 4 tiny allen screws and a tiny allen wrench that seems designed to frustrate anybody with adult sized hands. Inevitably, the wrench went flying a couple times for each screw.<br />Glad it's in because I don't want to do this one again."
I could only give this item one star. It was advertised to work with Bright House and it did not. They tried for three hours to get their system to acknowledge the modem and had no results. Obviously we are returning it. On a positive note this is a good looking unit and we wish it had worked. Arris name indicates a quality product. I guess we just had bad luck.
"I enjoy this mouse a lot, I like that it is Bluetooth. I mainly got it because I love the colors and it matches everything else in my room. But I found it works very well so far I have had it for a couple weeks now I work from home so it's a good addition to an at-home office set up!<br /><br />There has been one time where I had to take out the battery and reinsert it because it was lagging a bit but I have had no other problems other than that!"
"I needed a good neoprene case for my Acer spin laptop with a handle, and this one is excellent for my needs. The last case I bought had a side loading which I did not like. This HESTECH soft case has a top loading zippered sleeve to slide my laptop in. Plus there are two zippered pockets for my wires and accessories like my mouse.<br />Overall a very good case to own."
"The cover is very nice. However, even though it's made for my husbands kindle, it took me at least 20 minutes to get it on. I guess you could say it fits like a 'wet' glove. The problem is, I was going to give it to him for Father's Day, but it will not come off now! So I presented it to him the very day it came in the mail. Apparently a permanent fit! Did anyone even try it on when it was manufactured?"
"I'm not sure how I lived without this photo booth for so long! Truly!!! My husband and I are obsessed with Legos. But we do not have unlimited space or money, so once we've completed a build, it usually goes up for auction. This photo setup is so quick and easy; and it truly gives us professional looking photos!  I think it's made a huge difference with the resales too. I feel like our sets our getting bid up 10, 15 or maybe even 20% more now. It's crazy<br />It is made of out of sturdy, high quality materials too. Legos are heavy and have sharp edges so I was worried the vinyl would rip easily. But it's holding up beautifully. Plus storage is easy too. Once I'm done taking photos, it stores away nicely under my bed. I really am happy with it."
"So very dim it's all but impossible to see, even in pitch blackness. And the focus wheel is only sharp at the extreme end, every other position is uselessly fuzzy. Thanks, Amazon, for having such a good return policy."
I bought this to use with my PC and original PS4 Classic. While it works flawlessly with my PC it has significant issues with my PS4. The main issue is that it will not work unless I use the extension cable to attach it a USB port. It's worked one time without this method but every other time will not be recognized by my console until I use the USB extension cord. Also the product that I got came in a bulging box that looked like it had been haphazardly repackaged with smudges and scuffs on the actual unit to support this theory.
I love this laptop. It is so beautiful and works perfectly. It also arrived super fast. I love the brightness of the screen and the light on the keyboard.
"After trying to connect to wifi for 2 days, gave up and tried to send back. Every time I tried to get info to mail back, got notice that it couldn't go through. Have kindle fire and older kindle. No problems with them but wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
"The first thing I noticed when putting the headphones on my 6 year old son was that they were too big for him, even on the smallest size.<br />I put them on myself and the smallest size was slightly big for me but almost the right size. The biggest size is way to big and I’m not sure anyone could fit that size.<br />I’ve attached photos with my son and myself using the smallest and largest size.<br />The sound of the headphones is good and they are pretty comfortable.<br />I think that the highest volume could be too loud for a child so I will make sure that I watch how high the volume is. When the headphones are on the highest volume I can hear what the person is listening too when next to them. This makes it helpful with making sure to have them turn it down. But I would prefer that the volume wouldn’t go that loud as an option.<br />I’m giving these headphones a lower rating because I bought them for my children and they don’t fit them as well as I hoped."
"This did not work for me, I have a MAC computer  and for me I had a hard time trying to close the disk drawer.  The player is stuck in Region 2 and I am not smart enough to change to region 1.<br />This may be a very good player for someone who is more computer literate then I am, but I ended up getting another drive that was for MAC computers and didn't take a lot of understanding on how to plug it in, (why are there TWO plugs???).  OK I STILL USE A FLIP PHONE, but I don't know how to text so I DON'T need a phone smarter then I hope to be"
"Like a few others had mentioned in their reviews, the bluetooth on these is barely functional.  I've connected to a few devices and it is definitely the headphones that intermittently cut out rendering these pretty useless.  I've connected with the provided cable and the sound is ok, as is the noise cancellation.  For me, they are fairly comfortable up to about an hour, after that their is just a little too much pressure on my ears causing soreness.  Overall, bluetooth headphones that don't have functioning bluetooth are just overpriced wired headphones.  Be prepared to be underwhelmed."
Got too used to the Belkin version.  This one is cumbersome to use.  Very pretty though.
"I upgraded to this lens from the non-IS version of the 70-200mm as I was having problems getting  sharp shots not affected by hand shake.  The lens is rather long and heavy and the image stabilization comes in quite handy, especially with shots under low light conditions when you don't want to raise the ISO too high to compensate.  The IS can generally get you 2 stops more light than what you might ordinarily expect before experiencing hand shake blur.<br /><br />Images from this lens are very nice - sharp and good color, good bokeh at the wider apertures so you get nice separation between subject and background.  I took this lens to the zoo once and got lots of good shots with it, I've been very pleased with its performance.<br /><br />I use this lens on a full-frame camera, so keep in mind that if you are buying this for a camera with a cropped sensor, the actual focal range is more like a 110-320mm."
"Pro:<br />Impressive list of spec and nifty features<br />Very good clearance for over-sized CPU cooler<br />Auto OC feature for OC beginners<br />Very stable board @ 100% load 24x7<br />Good suite of utilities from Asus<br />Tons of USB ports<br />Outstanding audio, quite a standout from the rest<br /><br />Con:<br />No space between the two PCI-E slots, so the first video card gets little airflow and runs hot in a dual card setup (SLI or Crossfire)<br />Its built-in auto OC feature can only OC the i7 2600K to 4.4GHz*<br />* can be manually tweaked to go higher.<br />Once OC'ed, the M/B creates serious radio interference to garage door opener<br />Cannot control the secondary CPU fan speed<br />No DVI port<br />No built-in Wireless LAN<br /><br />Overall it works fine, but I would've bought something else if I got to do this all over again"
"The device works fine with the apps that are intended for it.<br /><br />The cover of this product shows a lot of popular apps that are supported, the deception is that other popular apps could also be supported because of this, which is not the case.<br /><br />You can't play pokemon go on this device, even if you install externals packages to support it, I couldn't get the device's location services to detect my phone's tethered GPS using native hot spot or GPS tethering apps.<br /><br />Save yourself some time if you want to use this for Pokemon Go.  Buy it if you are drawn to the specific things featured on the cover (lots of other apps are supported)."
"Would be great, but the wrist rests are metal and pictures too far and hurts."
"I've just started using these magnetic-type charging cables, and I started with another brand (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B342CMN), which have been working great for me. But I needed more, so I thought I'd try these. They connect to my older magnetic cables as well as the ones that came with this set. I love that this product is conveniently packaged in a nice hard case, unlike the other one. But for some reason I get the message when charging with these that it's low-charging and to connect the device with the original charging cable that came with it. I'm not sure why this is. Is it because I have too many cables plugged into my surge suppressor with USB charging ports? Is it because of incompatability with my devices (mainly my Samsung S8 phone)? I just don't know enough to know. So take my three-star rating as a middle-of-the-road reaction to the product as it's working for me in my space, not an overall ""Meh"" rating."
update sept 5 2018<br /><br />the device workd wonderfull for about 6 months and then it start disconnecting by it self so in other words it start to die..<br /><br />When i bought this it have 5 star now it got only 3 but what i know is that it have recommend this device for a nice amount of ppl they are happy with this product<br /><br />The thing with hubs is very complicated because every hub may work or will not work on your device and sometimes is this device noot the correct one for you but i have been working with hubs for a while so a can tell u the following<br /><br />A hub depends on your model and make<br /><br />A thunderbolt hub will most likely make trubble if the port is not thunderbolt<br /><br />If it's not working for u just try a different hub<br /><br />This device is working great so far on 6 Lenovo machines that i tried it it does the job and I'd have many ports to use<br /><br />Enjoy it.
Bought for a co-worker.  He loves it.
"It's a great looking power supply with good features, but I'll never know how it works as it will not fit my HP Envy TouchSmart 15 Notebook PC, Model 15-j023cl.<br /><br />The right angle plug fits the outside diameter, but the original AC adapter has a little blue ring around the tip (this one is yellow) and a very tiny pin in the middle called a &#34;smart pin,&#34; whatever that means. It's the weirdest connector I've ever seen.<br /><br />I need a replacement for p/n 709985-003. Or, as it says on the OEM power supply, &#34;replace with HP Spare 710412-001. Confusing enough? So do you order the first, original number or the second &#34;spare&#34; number?<br /><br />Had to send it back."
"Product states that you just need Wi-Fi to set it up, but you don’t need Wi-Fi to keep up with the chrome cast. That’s a lie I couldn’t get the product to stay connected."
"These are perfect. I was so happy that I went around labelling everything! The labels stick well, and even better, it is easy to remove the backing. There is a split down the middle, no more ruining your label by digging at the end to peel off the back. I am also pleased with the value for the price. The number of different colors included in the package gives you a good option for any labelling need. I will definitely purchase again and from this seller."
"Have been using the headphone jack on my iphone in my car since i have had an iphone. Decided to give this a chance, and wow there is clearly a difference in sound quality, much much better. Like other reviews have said it does not stay snug and when driving can easily become loose. The biggest problem i have is it, for whatever reason, it did not work with my existing aux cable, which was a griffin flat cable. I figured it should work with any set of headphones or any aux cable, does not seem to be the case as i tried a pair of JVC earbuds i use with the phone and only produces sound on ones side. We will see how long i can last with this and these minors annoyances, but when it does work with the provided aux cable, it does sound fantastic. At this point i cannot go back to using the headphone jack on the iphone knowing the major difference in sound quality with the PocketDock plugged in."
"Appears to be quality, insulated copper (not copper coated aluminum) wire. Perfect for my application (power injection for LED pixels)."
Not sure if  I got the same product as the other people who have reviewed on Amazon. The volume is lower than the tiny speaker that on m mp3 player. The only way to here any sound is put your ear right on top of the speakers. No way will you be able to hear this if you put it under a pillow. But the unit I receive does not look like the one pictured on Amazon's web site so maybe they have changed the design to this inferior product do not buy it is a waste of money.
"These phones are extremely uncomfortable, difficult to fit, have a tinny/washed out sound, and zero bottom end. I upped the rating from 1* to 2* because they come with nice accessories, including two cables -- one with a mic and one without. That's a nice touch.<br /><br />Before you say that the sound was bad because I didn't wear them properly: No. I have UE and Shure IEMs and am perfectly aware of how to achieve a seal, etc. I tried every tip these MEE phones came with, plus two different Comply models, and was unable to get anything worthwhile. The MEE phones are so sensitive to angle that if you have them even slightly askew in your ear you'll hear nothing. And even perfectly aligned, total weakness.<br /><br />Not recommended at all."
"This is a great external DVD R/W, easy plug and play for Windows 10, you won't go wrong to buy this product.<br />I highly recommend it for anybody that needs a good external DVD R/W drive. But it will not work with Windows 10"
"I'm giving this card reader one star because I suppose it may work for for someone, somewhere.  However, it does not work with my iMac.  I have AppleCare for my iMac, so I called Apple for technical assistance.  They walked me through many checks to see if they could get my iMac to recognize this card reader, all to no avail."
"I got this as the secondary router for the Verizon three router solution (described here: http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16858). I wanted a cheap wired router with the necessary configuration options, and this fit the bill just fine. The whole setup seems to be working like a charm."
Doesn't charge as fast as it claims. And yes I have a charger port capable of it my other older cords charge better. Wouldn't reccomend these
I've had them for a few years now and they still work just as good as the first day. Good sound quality. A good overall value for the price!
Half of the zip ties snapped in half while tightening.
"These look so cute, but they are no good. The sound is no good."
"Cheap cheap cheap product at a premium price.  What I received is all plastic except the spring, bolt, and nut.  The section that has the pivot is plastic which is the first time ever with all of the Ram mount products I have.  This item should be around 12 bucks at most.  Starting to believe the other reviews that this will not hold up.<br /><br />After a few days... the pole is no longer straight.  Not sure what I'm going to do... I sent an email to Ram Mount so lets see what they tell me.  I would advise others to avoid this product if you plan in using a hot car."
"THIRD PAIR in a row that has now broken, within less than a couple years. This last pair was only a couple months old. It made a small beep sound then would not turn on or charge, and is just dead. DO NOT buy these if you want reliable headphones. Big bummer."
"Fitbit's are great. Unfortunately, the watch screen is starting to split which is very disappointing. I've not had issues with past fitbit products."
Works better than anticipated.  Good buy.
The sound quality and everything is good so far as I have only been using for a couple days. Will update if anything changes.
"I use this to work from home a couple of days a week. It's huge. Plenty of resolution for basic needs. I wouldn't use it for precise photo editing necessarily, but even if I did I think it would be okay. Great for other productivity or utilitarian purposes. Plenty of sacred space to keep 4 or 5 windows or programs open at once."
"I got this for connecting classic games to my modern TV.  It works well with N64, NES, Gamecube, and VCRs!"
"I got these for my online courses for college. Unfortunately, they barely block out the surrounding noises. They initially star out comfortable when wearing them, but eventually they started hurting my ears. The sound and volume control were nice."
"I purchased this product. I took the product on a trial run. I was disappointed. If you have the financial means, purchase a bit of soft scrub. It will work much better. In the trash ""Pink"" goes."
The backdrop was absolutely perfect to take photos of my twin's birthday party.  It looks very realistic and I honestly didn't have time to add to it with hay bales or pumpkins and it still made the photographs pop.  I could see this being used by a professional photography or amateur like myself easily.
Stopped working after 3 weeks power button stuck
"It was cool for a month or two, then it wasn't.  After a couple months, it stopped working: no computer would respond to it.  It didn't even know it was plugged it.  I have a ton of info on it that most of it is now lost...<br /><br />This was my first post when I just received it and used it for the first time:<br /><br />This flash drive is crazy small and crazy huge memory capacity!  I was surprised, in a good way, by it's small size, and very pleased that it's so smooth and sleek, and it fits perfectly on my keychain.  It's also password protected so no one else can get my stuff off of it.  It holds as much memory as my iPod and iPad does!  It's very simple to use.  I keep thinking of new things to put on it: resume, work documents, music, videos, pictures, etc etc etc, and it still have so much memory left on it.  If there was a reason to own more than 1, I would."
The charge port broke the first time it was plugged in. Before it had ever been used. So can’t speak for sound quality
The speaker is at the bottom which muffles the sound. I wish it was at the top. Had to return it
"My experience with projectors lies mainly with updated middle school and high school projectors that cost hundreds of dollars.  Comparing this to those, you're about 75% of the way there.  If you need something within a medium sized room and don't need the sharpest quality, this will do just fine.  It has held up fine after a year of use.  It does get kind of hot and noisy if you're using it all day.  Best not to strain it, I think.<br /><br />4/5"
Please correct your download link in the email sent to me. Right off the bat I feel frustrated with this because I clicked on the<br />download terms link you provided in the email and it went to a not found page no download.When I right clicked and saved then adobe pdf reader said it wasn't formed right so it couldn't read the file. I am giving it 3 stars simply because I did get an email. I haven't used the service yet so I don't know if it is good or not but if the broken link to and explanation of the terms is any indication of the service then perhaps I ought to give it less stars.
It's barely strong enough to hold the wyze cam pan at an angle. Would not hold the camera horizontal.
