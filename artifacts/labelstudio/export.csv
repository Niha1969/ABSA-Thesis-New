I'd give it a 5 star rating if not for one complaint and it's a big one. THE DARNED MICRO-B USB PORT! The first year he had it, he went through two chargers and had to have the tablet replaced once because of his little 4 year old hands trying to force the stupid ONE-WAY CABLE into the little slot. I think this is a design flaw, when even my adult devices (except for Amazon devices) have a MICRO-C USB--which has no right way or upside down way. Why on earth would you make a device for kids like that? I know. Don't let them plug it in. You try telling a 5 year old who says, &#34;I can do it&#34; that &#34;No. You can't.&#34; Well, at 6, he's finally learned to plug it in and makes sure I know that there is an upside-down.

Comparing this to those, you're about 75% of the way there.  If you need something within a medium sized room and don't need the sharpest quality, this will do just fine.  It has held up fine after a year of use.  It does get kind of hot and noisy if you're using it all day.  Best not to strain it, I think.<br /><br />4/5","2025-08-31T22:19:58.045567Z"

Right off the bat I feel frustrated with this because I clicked on the<br />download terms link you provided in the email and it went to a not found page no download.When I right clicked and saved then adobe pdf reader said it wasn't formed right so it couldn't read the file. I am giving it 3 stars simply because I did get an email. I haven't used the service yet so I don't know if it is good or not but if the broken link to and explanation of the terms is any indication of the service then perhaps I ought to give it less stars.","2025-08-31T22:20:06.192800Z"
